Analyze this web UI screenshot for visual quality and usability issues.

Pay close attention to:
- Whether navigation and primary actions are visible and not obscured
- Drawer/menu positioning and safe-area padding on mobile layouts
- Tables and metadata displays: are they readable and properly formatted?
- Whether overlays or popups obscure important UI or the medical viewer canvas
- Text sizing and contrast at the captured zoom level
- Overlap/crowding that makes the UI hard to use

Common issues to flag:
- HIGH severity: primary actions hidden, critical workflow information unreadable, major overlays blocking the viewer
- MEDIUM severity: text partially cut off, menus hard to dismiss, tables cramped or hard to read
- LOW severity: minor spacing issues, slight overlap that does not block key information

Describe any problems you see in 1-2 clear sentences, or say "No major issues" if the UI looks good.
