You are auditing a medical image viewer UI. Evaluate the screenshot and respond **only** with JSON that matches the schema below—no prose, markdown, or explanation outside of the JSON object.

```json
{
  "severity": "low|medium|high",
  "summary": "One sentence in <=25 words",
  "checks": {
    "buttonsClipped": true|false,
    "canvasCoveragePercent": 0-100,
    "headerAligned": true|false,
    "textLegible": true|false,
    "controlsCompact": true|false
  },
  "violations": ["short bullet strings describing concrete problems"],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

Interpretation rules:
1. **Buttons / controls** – Mark `buttonsClipped=true` if any interactive control (hamburger menu, sidebar action buttons, dataset sample buttons, close button) is cropped, partially off-screen, or obscured.
2. **Canvas visibility** – Estimate how much of the viewport is occupied by the medical image/canvas. Set `canvasCoveragePercent` accordingly and add violations if <70% (desktop/tablet) or <60% (phones). Treat large black/blank regions where the slide should be as zero coverage.
3. **Header alignment** – `headerAligned=true` only if the fixed header does not overlap/cover content and its elements (hamburger, workspace selector, spinner) are aligned without collisions.
4. **Text legibility** – `textLegible=false` if any key label is blurry, cut off, or too small to read comfortably (e.g., "Workspace", "Actions", "Dataset samples", sample names).
5. **Compactness** – On narrow layouts, `controlsCompact=true` only if the header and sidebar controls fit without horizontal scrolling and remain easy to use (no overlap, no tiny touch targets).
6. **General usability** – List every observed issue in `violations`. If no problems, return an empty array.
7. **JSON validity** – Never include raw double quotes inside string values. If you must mention a label, wrap it in single quotes or escape quotes with `\\\"`.
8. **Context** – If additional CONTEXT is provided, treat it as the intended UI state for the screenshot (e.g., sidebar expected open/closed, ROI expected visible).

Severity rules (apply them before returning the JSON):
- **High** if buttons are clipped, canvas coverage <50%, or header alignment is broken.
- **Medium** if any other check fails or the canvas coverage is between 50–69% (desktop/tablet) or 50–59% (phone).
- **Low** only when all checks pass and `violations` is empty.

If the screenshot is perfect, set `severity:"low"` and `summary:"No major issues"`. Otherwise explain the dominant defect in `summary`. Do **not** output anything outside the JSON object.
