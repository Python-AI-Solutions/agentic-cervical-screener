Analyze this medical documentation UI screenshot for visual quality and usability issues.

Pay close attention to:
- Orientation instructions and path visibility - are the steps clear?
- Drawer/menu positioning and safe-area padding - do menus have proper dismiss controls?
- Metadata displays, tables, and workflow notes - is all text readable and properly formatted?
- Whether any overlays or popups obscure the Niivue 3D viewer or important buttons
- Text sizing and contrast - can information be read easily at this screen size?
- Proper layout of documentation elements without crowding or overlap

Common issues to flag:
- HIGH severity: Instructions completely hidden, critical workflow information unreadable, major overlays blocking viewer
- MEDIUM severity: Text partially cut off, menus difficult to dismiss, metadata tables cramped or hard to read
- LOW severity: Minor spacing issues, slight overlap that doesn't block key information

Describe any problems you see in 1-2 clear sentences, or say "No major issues" if the UI looks good.
