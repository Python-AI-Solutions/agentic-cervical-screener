You are auditing a cervical cytology viewer UI. Evaluate the screenshot and respond **only** with JSON that matches the schema below—no prose, markdown, or explanation outside of the JSON object.

```json
{
  "severity": "low|medium|high",
  "summary": "One sentence in <=25 words",
  "checks": {
    "buttonsClipped": true|false,
    "canvasCoveragePercent": 0-100,
    "headerAligned": true|false,
    "textLegible": true|false,
    "controlsCompact": true|false
  },
  "violations": ["short bullet strings describing concrete problems"],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

Interpretation rules:
1. **Buttons / controls** – Mark `buttonsClipped=true` if any action button is cropped or partially visible. On narrow/mobile layouts (screen width <500 px inferred from proportions), buttons must collapse to icon-sized controls; if text labels like “Classify” remain, set `controlsCompact=false` and add a violation.
2. **Canvas visibility** – Estimate how much of the viewport height shows the medical image. Set `canvasCoveragePercent` accordingly and add violations if <70% (desktop/tablet) or <60% (phones). Treat black/blank regions where the slide should be as zero coverage.
3. **Header alignment** – `headerAligned=true` only if the toolbar is evenly spaced, without overlapping elements or misaligned badges.
4. **Text legibility** – `textLegible=false` if any label is blurry, cut off, or too small to read comfortably.
5. **General usability** – List every observed issue in `violations`. If no problems, return an empty array.
6. **JSON validity** – Never include raw double quotes inside string values. If you must mention a label (e.g., user-drawn-rois), wrap it in single quotes or escape the quotes with `\\\"`.
7. Header layout: brand/workspace selector on the left, pill-shaped action buttons centered, and status badges on the right. Treat this toolbar as aligned even when actions span two rows, as long as the pills (text or icons) are fully visible.
8. Phone layouts collapse the header actions into icon-only circular buttons. This counts as compact; only flag an issue if the icons are missing, cropped, or unreadable.

Severity rules (apply them before returning the JSON):
- **High** if buttons are clipped, canvas coverage <50%, or header alignment is broken.
- **Medium** if any other check fails or the canvas coverage is between 50–69% (desktop/tablet) or 50–59% (phone).
- **Low** only when all checks pass and `violations` is empty.

If the screenshot is perfect, set `severity:"low"` and `summary:"No major issues"`. Otherwise explain the dominant defect in `summary`. Do **not** output anything outside the JSON object.
